# TrueRandom

### Finally **TRUE RANDOM** 🎉

![It's Finally Happened](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.tenor.com%2Fmz4hwDwkAz4AAAAM%2Fits-finally-happened-wren-weichman.gif&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=d1f292575d35f39d7fee081873e99d5d42909382feac833dcd739b2fd655a35b)

**TrueRandom** generates a random number based on the hex values of each character in random Twitch chat messages.

## The Only Ways This Isn't Random

This method is as random as the human mind itself. The only ways this could *not* be truly random are:

1. **[Dead Internet Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory)** is true - if most internet activity (including Twitch chat) is actually bots 🤖 rather than real humans
2. **[Determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism)** is true - if all human actions are predetermined and free will doesn't exist ⚙️
3. I have written poor logic 🐛

Unless you believe that the internet is run by bots or that human free will is an illusion, there is nothing more random than Twitch chat! 🎲✨
